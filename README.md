# FDS

- frontend is for the frontend stuff LOL
- backend is for the api stuff
- database for the sql files

(frontend-old is last time stuff can ignore hehe)

to run server:
1. setup database in postgres called fakegrabdb
2. run init.sql file (in database folder) for fakegrabdb
3. cd backend
4. npm run setup

to run client:
1. npm start

***** run 'npm install' in the folder after cloning/pulling
***** make sure to run server first then client (so server is on localhost:3000)
